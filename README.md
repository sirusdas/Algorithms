#Linked List Documentations using object oriented approach:
=====================================
>We create 3 file:
--------------------
>Node.py
	The basic framework of a node. It will have variables like...
		>> data: To store the linkedlist varible
		>> nextNode: To store object reference of nextNode
		
	Method remove():
		>> Will be used to remove the requested node.
		

>LL.py
	The LinkedList Logic is defined here!
		>> head: Store the loction of the first element in the LinkedList
		>> counter: To display the total elements in an array
		
	Method insertStart(self, data):
		Insert the value at the start of string.
		
	Method insertEnd(self, data):
		Insert the value at the end of the string.
		
	Method size(self): 
		Return the counter value
		
	Method traverseList(self):
		Displays all the elements in the Linked List.
		
	Method remove(self, data):
		Remove the requested element.

>main.py
	This is the file which we run!
	
###NOTE: This is just the basic structure of framework. Check code to know more!
